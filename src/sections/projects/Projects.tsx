                            "Superfluous Weather" is a Kubernetes showcase project designed to deepen my understanding of Kubernetes and the deployment of scalable services. This project features a straightforward weather service that delivers weather forecasts for cities. Constructed atop a Kubernetes cluster, it integrates a Postgres database for user authentication and a MongoDB database for rudimentary caching. Monitoring is accomplished through Grafana and Prometheus. Initially deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service, the project was eventually decommissioned to mitigate costs. The primary objective of "Superfluous Weather" was to enhance my skills in containerization and cluster management.'
