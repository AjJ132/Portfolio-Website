              <strong>ProServ</strong> was conceived to simplify the process of
              coaches assigning workouts to their athletes. As a sophomore in
              college when I initiated this project, I had to juggle several
              factors, including time, cost, and complexity. Balancing my
              academic and collegiate athlete schedule, I managed to dedicate
              approximately an hour or two each day to this venture.
            </p>
            <p>
              The development of <strong>ProServ</strong> commenced at the start
              of May and continues as of this writing on July 13, 2023. The
              project is hosted on Azure, utilizing an ASP.NET backend server
              and Blazor WebAssembly for the front end. I opted for this
              configuration due to my affinity for the .NET family and its range
              of third-party libraries, such as Radzen.
            </p>
            <p>
              The project incorporates a compact CI/CD pipeline on GitHub,
              encompassing stages for building, testing, and deploying. As of
              now, the <strong>ProServ</strong> mobile iOS app is under
              development, slated to use the same backend server for its
              requests.
            </p>
            <p>
              My experience with Blazor revealed some hurdles, primarily due to
              its limited support. However, I appreciate the widespread adoption
              of C#, my primary language. I also found Nuget packages invaluable
              for accelerating the development process, despite Blazor
              WebAssembly's relatively high memory usage and increased load
              times. I'm optimistic about .NET 8 potentially introducing
              features to enable a hybrid approach to server-side rendering and
              client-side handling, but this remains speculative. Links to the
              Github repo and website are below.
